# Image Tessellation

![Image Tessellation Demo](./image-tessellation.gif)

A Processing sketch that creates mosaic art by reconstructing a target image using a collection of related images. The program fetches images from Pixabay based on a keyword, then intelligently arranges them to recreate a chosen target image, creating an engaging visual effect where zooming out reveals the larger picture.

## Features
- Dynamic image fetching from Pixabay API
- Real-time image analysis and matching
- Interactive grid size adjustment
- Toggle between mosaic and original view
- Automatic image resizing and color matching

## Tech Stack
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) - Creative coding framework
- [Http-Requests-for-Processing](https://github.com/runemadsen/HTTP-Requests-for-Processing) - HTTP library
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) - Image source

## How It Works
1. Fetches a collection of images from Pixabay based on a keyword
2. Selects one image as the target
3. Divides the target image into a grid
4. Analyzes the color composition of each grid section
5. Matches grid sections with similar images from the collection
6. Creates a dynamic mosaic that can be toggled between views

## Controls
- Mouse Click: Toggle between mosaic and original view
- Right/Left Arrow Keys: Switch between target images
- Up/Down Arrow Keys: Adjust grid resolution

## Setup
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/)
2. Install the HTTP Requests library from Processing's library manager
3. Sign up for [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
4. Get your API key from [Pixabay API docs](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)
5. Set your API key in the `APIKey` variable
6. Adjust `keyword` variable to change the theme of collected images
7. Run the sketch
